## Risks and risk management
### 1. Data Vulnerability
- Data can be easily accessed, changed, or stolen if there are weak security measures in place which doesn’t allert us while the usage. 

- Risk Management: Improving the security method by installing strong data encryption methods, authorised access controls, frequent data back up, and conduct vulnerability assessments in order to find and address any potential vulnerabilities. 
(National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2017). Computer Security Resource Center).

### 2. System Malfunction
- There is a risk of system failure or malfunction because of the software bugs, viruses, hardware disfunction, or compatibility issues.

- Risk Management: Running a full analysis, testing and quality assurance processes to identify and fix any software or hardware issues. Frequent update and maintenance of the system components to ensure the optimal system performance. 
(Gary Stoneburner, Alice Goguen, and Alexis Feringa  ,Computer Security Division Information Technology Laboratory National Institute of Standards and Technology Gaithersburg, MD 20899-8930, July 2002)
### 3. Inadequate User Training
- Clients may not be enough prepared to utilize the library framework, prompting blunders, information misfortune, or security breaks.

- Risk Management: 
Scheduling regular training programs and teaching them to use the recourses and supports. Must ensure their skills and knowledge about the system so that there will be no more issues in the future. Giving them chance to explain and getting feedback from the users and providing the essential upgraded tasks to skill them up (Ilia Sotnikov ,Published: August 2, 2018).
### 4. Integration Challenges
- Further developing the library framework with other existing frameworks or data sets might present difficulties, prompting similarity issues or information irregularities.  

- Risk Management: Direct intensive examination and wanting to recognize potential combination challenges. Foster a movement plan that incorporates information approval and compromise processes. Team up intimately with partners and IT offices to guarantee smooth combination. 
 ( Breen, D., Monahan, B., Cullen, N., & O'Sullivan, D. (2008). Methods and Tools for Managing the Risk in Systems Integration. IT Professional, 10(4), 20-26. DOI: 10.1109/MITP.2008.86)
 
### 5. Security Breaches
- There is a risk of unauthorized access, hacking, or malware attacks on the library system and its associated networks.
- Risk Management: Carry out far reaching safety efforts like firewalls, interruption recognition frameworks, and antivirus programming. Consistently update security fixes and guarantee that all product and frameworks are modern. Lay out episode reaction plans and lead ordinary security reviews. 
(U.S. Department of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., Secretary)


### 6.  Hardware Glitch 
- This hazard alludes to the chance of the actual parts of the library framework (like servers, PCs, or organization hardware) neglecting to work appropriately, bringing about framework free time and potential information misfortune.
 
- Risk management-  Routinely review and keep up with the equipment to distinguish any potential issues ahead of time. Execute overt repetitiveness measures, for example, reinforcement servers or Strike stockpiling to limit the effect of equipment disappointment. Moreover, make a far reaching calamity recuperation plan that incorporates reinforcements, offsite capacity, and a reasonable methodology to reestablish the framework rapidly.

### 7. Data unfound or loss 
- This hazard involves the misfortune or inaccessibility of critical information put away in the library framework, which can happen because of unintentional erasure, framework misfires, or digital assaults.
 
- Risk management-  Consistently reinforcement all information and guarantee the reinforcements are put away safely. Execute severe access controls to forestall unapproved alterations or erasures. Use encryption strategies to get delicate information and consider having numerous duplicates of information put away in geologically assorted areas.

### 8. Programming bugs and errors
- This chance alludes to blunders or glitches in the product utilized inside the library framework, possibly prompting framework crashes, information debasement, or compromised security.
 
- Risk management-  Lead thorough testing and investigating during the advancement stage to recognize and wipe out programming bugs. Use robotized testing devices and execute normal programming updates and fixes to address distinguished weaknesses. Moreover, follow secure coding practices to limit the gamble of presenting programming bugs. 

### 9. Changing requirements or scope creep
  
- Risk Management : In order to reduce the possibility of scope creep, clearly identify the project goals and scope from the outset. Retain regular lines of communication with interested parties to quickly address any additions or modifications to the criteria. To guarantee effective administration and control, track and document every change.

## Glossary 
### 1. Agile model 
Agile is a methedology of project management and software  development that focuses on iteration. This approach allows teams to deliver value to customers in a faster and more efficient manner. Instead of depending on a single large launch, an agile team focuses on delivering smaller, easily digestible increments of work. (Rahul Arun, simpli learn blog, 2 November 2023)

### 2. DevOps model 
DevOps overcomes any issues between programming improvement and activities. This approach cultivates cooperative energy among improvement and tasks groups, empowering a cooperative and shared liability culture. It is a computer programming strategy that means to flawlessly incorporate the endeavors of the two groups.

### 3.  Gantt chart 
It is a chart that is commonly used for the project management which contains a time scale and the list of activities, it is used for noting down the time period and allocating the tasks. 

### 4. Incremental model:
This model is a course of programming improvement where the requirements  are separated into various independent modules of programming improvement cycle. It is finished in strides from examination plan, execution, testing/confirmation, support. ( Matthew Martin, 28 October 2023 @Guru99)

### 5. Kanban
It is a popular frame work that helps us to work for implementing agile and many other software which allows us to work on it at any time. 


### 6.Software Process Model 
  
It’s the methodology of dividing the software development work into the distinct phase in order to improve the design, product and project management.  This defines tasks which is to be performed, the input, output and the processing of each task, the conditions of the task and the sequence of the task. 
  
### 7. System requirements
 System requirements are the functional and non-functional specifications that a software system must meet to satisfy its customers' needs that includes the design, the development, and the testing of the system. 

### 8. Waterfall Model :
It follows a successive idealistic methodology where each stage is finished prior in order to move to the next one for doing in a large and difficult projects.It has an organized and formalized process however needs adaptability and versatility to changes. 

### 9. User requirements definition 
The basic needs of the user to work on a software system which helps them to give the expected output.
